PassHash
=

This is a very simple utility website which hashes a password using PHP's native password hashing function.

The use cases will be *very* narrow, but sometimes when developing a new project I want to quickly be able to generate a password hash to change a password directly in the database and I too lazy to fire up one of the PHP codepads that is up at that time.
